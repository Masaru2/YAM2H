# YAM2H - Yet another Mother 2 Hack

The aiming of this project is to make Earthbound as closest to Mother 2 as possible while keeping it vanilla EB/M2. ("Unlike nothing ever done before")
with the difference is restoring stuff unnoticed by these called "Restoration projects".

#Origin

Back in September 2019, I tried to port the Maternalbound Redux script to older versions of Maternalbound and shared it
to Shadowone333 as some kind of response of Redux changing a lot of things in terms of gameplay and graphics.
This leaded up to basically nothing.

5 or 6 years later, in October 2025, I discovered that CoolGuyBrendyn shared its source code
for his hack "Mother 2: Perfect Edition" and started working on it for the "funnies"
digging out the stuff I did back in 2019, starting this project.

#Features
-Graphics, Tilesets and Sprites reverted as how they were in Mother 2
-Ported the script from Maternalbound Redux, albeit with some changes
-Translated Debug Mode (Ported from Maternalbound Redux)
-Restored the CAST secuence changing colors depending of the flavor you chose like in Mother 2
-Added "Clyde Mandelin" name in the credits

#Script changes from Maternalbound Redux

-"Tendas" are now called "Gumi" like in Mother 2
-"Scarabia" is now called "Scarabi" like in Mother 2
-A punk now says "Hello!" instead of "Oh yeah?" which is a known localization mistake in Earthbound
-Changed "Stop looking at my hips" to "Stop looking at my butt" which is a closer approximation of what was the original intention

#Known Issues

-The title screen is not 1:1 to the japanese version of Mother 2.
This is because the title screen in Earthbound is handled in such a different way than it does in Mother 2
